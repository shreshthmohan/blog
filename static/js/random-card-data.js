    myNotes:
      "So making money to acheive this level might be enough. You might not need to suffer for more than what you need. The other day I was talking to a friend about what his fuck-you money number was. His number was twice as much as mine. The reason, he wanted to buy a place to be able to run a learning center. But I argued that he needed less as he didn't need to buy the place. He could just rent it. That way he would need less money to start the learning centre and could do it sooner too. You think need more, but there are ways around it. You can solve the same problem differently and with less money.",
