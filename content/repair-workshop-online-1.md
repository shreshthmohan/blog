A few days back I organized an electronics repair workshop for fellow members of <span class="text-black">Beautiful Bengaluru</span>. I was in doubt about the value of running an online version of a workshop that's usually done offline. But desperate times call for desperate measures.

## What are we try to achieve?

What I have often seen is that people tend to throw away devices that can be easily repaired. Partly because they can't figure out why that piece of technology stopped working and partly because it has become so easy to buy a replacement with a click of a button. I saved a friend about ₹8000 (~$100) by cleaning the battery contacts of her instant camera. Before she knew that I did simple repairs, she was planning to trash the seemingly broken camera and buy a new one!

I have seen a lot of other people do this and it bothers me. So this is simply an attempt to fix that.

This workshop attempts to educate people about common precautions and easy repairs one can do that could save a lot of money, headache, precious resources, and divert a lot of waste from the landfill.

## How the offline version usually works

We ask people to bring their broken electronic devices or electrical appliances that need fixing. Usually something they don't mind becoming permanently dead. We don't want people cursing us later. If we can fix the thing, great! If not we learn more about how that piece of tech works. (what precautions you can take next time you're using that piece of tech)

When we run the offline workshop we often work in one or two groups and share the tools we have. It's easier for people to learn from the person repairing, they can just watch and ask questions. They aren't constantly distracted by a live video meeting.

## Online is (expectedly) very different

To prepare for the shortcomings of an online workshop, I asked people for details of their broken items, a detailed description of the problem, and tools available. I planned to prioritize repairs that could be made with the limited set of tools they had.

But things didn't go as planned. Most people didn't provide a detailed description of the issues with their devices. Probably because most of the responses were some form of "it doesn't work!" I should have asked specific questions about the issues.

- Does it never work?
- When was the last time it worked?
- If it works in certain conditions what are those conditions?
- Have you tried fixing it? If yes, what have you tried?
- Have you figured out what's wrong, but don't know how to fix the problem?

So I asked questions on a case-by-case basis before the workshop in the WhatsApp group we had set up for the workshop.

A few people attempted to fix their stuff, before the workshop even started, via the WhatsApp group. I thought that was great!

Varsha didn’t even join the call and was initially not confident about opening up her broken Philips Home Theatre system. <span class="text-black">She thought she didn’t have enough tools to open it up, but ended up opening it up on her own using her cycle repair toolkit!</span>

## The Zoom Call

As should have been obvious to me earlier we didn't do much fixing during the actual video call for the workshop. Before we jumped into 'fixing' things we briefly talked about a [few things](https://shreshth.dev/common-precautions-easy-repairs/).

- Common precautions anyone could follow to avoid repairs and make the devices last longer. For example, if we turned on the switch after plugging in the device, that would increase the life of the device.
- Some easy repairs that could be made without tools or with very basic tools. Like, a lot of defunct battery-powered devices start working after you just clean the battery contacts.

After that, we individually walked through each person's broken devices and discussed each repair in detail. If they had already attempted a repair we encouraged them to talk about how they did it detail.

- How they went about the repair?
- What resources and tools they used?
- What worked and what did not?

I shared inputs on what could have been done better or what precautions to take when using that item. I also talked about how the device worked.

After we had walked through all of the broken items we talked about planned obsolescence, durability, repairability, and simple strategies one could use to fix things on their own.

<!-- planned obsolescence. (some intentional - more money, some unintentional - more complex electronics is harder to fix and make repairable. companies would have to spend extra resources on engineering products that are more repairable) -->
<!-- Strategies: youtube, google, ifixit? Knowing what to search for is important -->

## Takeaways and Feedback

- It is not easy to fix things without the right tools
- It is more difficult to explain to people how to do a repair through an online medium
- A few people wanted us to organize the workshop for kids, mostly teenagers. I think we could have adults and kids in the same workshop.
- A few DIYers were interested in diving into more complex repairs. I have intentionally avoided doing complex repairs for the workshop because it takes a lot of time and focus. Maybe we can have a separate workshop for more complex repairs only for people more comfortable with making repairs themselves.

<span class="bg-orange-100">The point we want to drive home is that a lot of repairs are often much easier than people think. Some basic knowledge about how our gadgets work can save us a lot of headaches and making those simple repairs can save time, money, and precious resources.</span>

<!-- Ask people to comment while someone else is talking and we discuss that after they're done. "Don't interrupt, but share" We take it up if enough people think it's interesting.. -->
