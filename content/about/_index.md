I got my hands dirty with <a class="underline" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreshthmohan/" target="_blank">a lot of things</a> before getting into software full-time. I am quitting my job to work for myself.

I am currently working on:

1. Building a web application to replace a 20-year-old legacy shell-based application my client uses to design power transformers for the Indian energy generation and distribution network
2. Developing a comprehensive power transformer course for engineers so that they can easily design transformers using the above web application

While I build this web app I am going to share detailed information about building and designing power transformers.

This website is an attempt to share and record my learnings as I try to fend for myself. Though my recent experience has been in software, I won't be writing much about software or programming.

If you wish to talk to me about something, <a class="underline" href="https://twitter.com/shreshthmohan" target="_blank">tweet at me</a>
