I have gotten my hands dirty with a lot of things before getting to software full-time.

After being rejected by several Indian companies for not having enough experience in software, I thought of trying my luck at getting a remote job in software. Luckily, I landed my first software job with just one attempt.

I started this blog as an attempt to record my learnings. I plan to write about a lot of topics apart from software.

If you wish to talk to me about something, <a class="underline" href="https://twitter.com/shreshthmohan">tweet at me</a>
