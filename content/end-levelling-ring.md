A typical transformer winding, especially of the helical or spiral type, is not a perfect cylinder. So after being wound, there's a trapezoidal void which needs filling. Pressboard is cut into shape to fill this gap and make the winding into a cylindrical shape. We call this piece of pressboard an 'end-levelling strip'. Doing so increases the winding height, and we need to consider that for our clearance calculations. However, the electrical properties of the winding remain unaffected.
