## This is a public draft, still a work in progress. :)

1. Common precautions
   1. Switch on after you plug in
   2. Switches off and plugs off when the weather is bad outside (rain and lightning).
   3. Battery powered devices - Donâ€™t leave them in when not in use for a long time. Especially for AA / AAA powered devices (cylindrical pencil cells)
2. Common repairs
   1. Battery contact cleanup and replacement. Fixing the springs.
   2. Opening the thing up and cleaning it out (hair related products: epilators, trimmers)
   3. Rechargeable Battery replacement (a little more involved.)
