## This is a public draft, will probably remain a draft forver! :)

I have been making a bunch of small repairs since I was a kid, I am now keeping track of what I fix so that maybe someone with a similar problem can find this useful. Right now it's just a list with very little details. But my plan is to document each repair in detail so that other people can derive value from it.

1. K's Edifier speakers. Replaced blown transformer with old MacBook charger (bypassed the rectifier). This was sort of a hack job and not a proper repair.
2. Ikea clock. Replaced corroded battery contacts with a pair from an old remote control (donâ€™t leave the batteries plugged in to avoid such damage)
3. Multiple MacBook chargers. (Opened the power brick, cut the frayed ends of the cable and re-soldered)
4. Tâ€™s Electric Kettle (I guided Sâ€™s son while he fixed it. Was a loose contact and malfunctioning thermostat mechanism)
5. Oâ€™s Braun Epilator (23 years old! We simply opened it up and cleaned it.)
6. Ex-Girlfriendâ€™s Fujifilm Instant Camera (cleaned battery contacts, she was gonna throw it buy a new one! Saved about 8000 rupees!)
