## This is a public draft, will probably remain a draft forver! :)

1. K's Edifier speakers. Replaced blown transformer with old MacBook charger (bypassed the rectifier)
2. Ikea clock. Replaced corroded battery contacts with a pair from an old remote control (donâ€™t leave the batteries plugged in to avoid such damage)
3. Multiple MacBook chargers. (Opened the power brick, cut the frayed ends of the cable and re-soldered)
4. Tâ€™s Electric Kettle (I guided Sâ€™s son while he fixed it. Was a loose contact and malfunctioning thermostat mechanism)
5. Oâ€™s Braun Epilator (23 years old! We simply opened it up and cleaned it.)
6. Ex-Girlfriendâ€™s Fujifilm Instant Camera (cleaned battery contacts, she was gonna throw it buy a new one! Saved about 8000 rupees!)
